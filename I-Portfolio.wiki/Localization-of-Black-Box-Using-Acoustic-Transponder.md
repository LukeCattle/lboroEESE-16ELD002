## Localization of Black Box Using Acoustic Transponder

The signal will be detected by two microphones on the DaNI subsystem, which will isolate the three frequencies. If all three are positively detected (in the known time period), the two microphones will use the loudness detected in each and find the direction in which the system must go in to get closer to the black box. The system will then relay the final location to the tri-track subsystem to then carry out its necessary task.
