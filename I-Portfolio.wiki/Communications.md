# Communications
Luke Cattle and Josh Crawford comprise the sub-team that is responsible for allowing the DaNI and Tri-Track to communicate with one another, as well as the ROV. This will ensure that the team members are able to monitor vital stats concerning the two robots, as well video streaming (possibly) on the Tri-Track. 

The communications sub-team will be responsible for interacting with both the Tri-Track and DaNI sub-teams, as a suitable solution must be found to allow both robots to communicate with each other, as well as allowing them to communicate with the ROV. 

Around the 1st of November it was discovered that a LAN will be setup and the robots shall communicate through RF technology. As a result of this it became clear that the communications aspect of the project would become smaller than anticipated and therefore both Josh Crawford and Luke Cattle will lend themselves to other areas of the project where necessary. They shall also lead project administration; this includes preparation of PST meetings as well as gateway meetings, as well as preparation of documentation and a focused awareness of project deadlines and gateways.
