# Dani
Callum Newman, Josh Crawford, Chris Gunn and Jonathan Balakumar are responsible for developing sub-systems that shall be integrated to form the wider DaNI sub-system. This robot is expected to explore the environment and then determine a safe path for the Tri-Track to move through to complete the mission.

To improve the DaNI systems ability to move across complex environments it has been extensively modified. The standard chassis has been replaced by a Tri-Track chassis, this is smaller than the original chassis and has the distinct advantage of using tracks rather than wheels, which make negotiating obstacles, such as ramps, far easier.

A Kinect sensor is being used to detect objects, as well as LED beacons and any hazards on the environment floor. An array of microphones has been employed to locate the black box via its acoustic signature.
