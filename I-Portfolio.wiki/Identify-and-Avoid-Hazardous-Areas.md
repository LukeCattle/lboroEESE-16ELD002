The hazard marker is shown to be yellow on the graphical user interface map after it has been detected.

This capability is to be completed by the DaNI subsystem, using the Kinect and the image/colour recognition software. The Kinect will detect the yellow on the hazard marker and navigate the Tri-Track to avoid these targets as well.
