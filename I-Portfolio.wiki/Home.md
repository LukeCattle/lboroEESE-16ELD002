## What is I.C.A.R.U.S

Icarus stands for 'Intelligent controllable autonomous remote underwater system'. It is our aim to provide an autonomous system that can detect and isolate a leaking valve in an underwater environment, as well as avoiding all hazardous obstacles and retrieving a black box. This ['how to navigate page'](https://github.com/lboroEESE-16ELD002/I-Portfolio/wiki/How-To-Navigate) will walk you through our progress and appropriate documentation.

## Project Overview

The project involves developing an autonomous system that shall be able to operate in an ‘underwater’ environment; the system will be capable of performing a number of tasks and should aim to do so with as little human control as possible (i.e. autonomy). The system will consist of a DaNI robot and a Tri-Track robot, as well as an ROV above the water.

The task involves controlling a valve on board a mocked up plane fuselage as well as locating and transporting to safety, a black box flight recorder. The system should demonstrate robust communications along with autonomy and the purpose of this portfolio is to define the boundaries of the project as well as the boundaries of the various sub-teams.
