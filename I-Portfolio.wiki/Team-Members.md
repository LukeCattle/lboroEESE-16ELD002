## Team Overview

During a team meeting on the 21st of October 2016 it was decided that team Icarus, comprising of 6 members, will be split into three sub-teams ([Tri-Track](https://github.com/lboroEESE-16ELD002/I-Portfolio/wiki/Tri-Track), [DaNI](https://github.com/lboroEESE-16ELD002/I-Portfolio/wiki/DaNI), [Communications](https://github.com/lboroEESE-16ELD002/I-Portfolio/wiki/Communications)). These teams will take overall responsibility for various aspects of the project, with regular full team meetings taking place so sub-teams can report progress and any issues that may affect the work of the other sub-teams. 

It is expected that throughout, though especially towards the latter stages of, the project there will be a large amount of overlap between sub-teams due to the need to integrate the various sub-systems; therefore, this document should be considered a guide as to what each sub-team’s scope is, rather than a hard and fast standard. In any case, communication as a whole team should be sufficient that any scope overlap can be dealt with between sub-teams.  

The system in its entirety will be designed in such a way so that each team member understands the solution and then is responsible for implementing this solution within their respective sub-teams. Working within sub-teams in this way will not compromise the project from an integration point of view.

## Team Update

From January of 2017 there have been changes to the sub-teams to reflect the new work that has been generated from previous tasks. These changes are as follows:

Jonathan Balakumar and Callum Newman are responsible for the DaNI subsystem; mapping and navigating around the environment, obstacle detection, hazard detection and the graphical user interface. 

Luke Cattle has taken responsibility for innovations within the project and is looking to integrate voice control and IMUs into the final solution whilst maintaining a level of autonomy deemed suitable by the PST.

Ben Peall has been working on the Tri-Track as well as developing object recognition software that will be implemented in the Tri-Track system so as to help identify the black box and control panel that the Tri-Track is expected to manipulate.

Christopher Gunn and Josh Crawford have been working on the acoustic detection for the black box, which will be implemented into the DaNI subsystem, for localisation and detection of the black box. They have also taken responsibility for the laser gimbal system.
