## Laser Gimbal Navigation Mount

A gimbal mount has been manufactured for the use of two gimbal motors and a laser to be ideally positioned and controlled. Figure 1 shows 3D image of the designed mount.

#### Figure 3. 3D Design of Laser/Gimbal Navigation Mount

This mount allows the mounting of the system onto an overhead support which allows a view of all parts of the map. 
The mount also gives the necessary movement to allow the two gimbals to manipulate the laser to be able to point it in the necessary direction without any friction, obstacles or other issues.
